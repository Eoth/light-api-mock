# Moving from lightMock to Mimicway

lightMock is now called **Mimicway**. It is the same program: the management API, the URLs of your mocked services, the environment variables, the configuration format and the data directory do not change. An existing `DATA_PATH` (with `mock-config.yaml`, `tcp-config.yaml` and `backups/`) is picked up as it is, and an exported configuration imports as it always did.

Only names change. Most of them need nothing from you; the table says which do.

| Before | Now | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Binary `light-mock` | `mimicway` | Update scripts and service units that start it. |
| Image built as `lightmock` | `mimicway`, published as `ghcr.io/eoth/mimicway` | Use the new name; keep your volume (see [Docker](#docker)). |
| `RUST_LOG=light_mock=debug` | `RUST_LOG=mimicway=debug` | Nothing urgent: the former name is still read, with a warning in the log. Update it when convenient. |
| Default Kafka consumer group `lightmock` | `mimicway` | Set `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP=lightmock` to keep consuming from your current offsets. |
| Language, theme and session saved by the browser | Same values, new keys | Nothing: they are moved on the first visit. |
| Kubernetes resources `lightmock`, volume `lightmock-data` | `mimicway`, `mimicway-data`, namespace `mimicway` | Keep your volume (see [Kubernetes](#kubernetes)). |
| Repository `github.com/Eoth/light-api-mock` | `github.com/Eoth/mimicway` | Nothing: old links and `git remote` URLs redirect. Update them when convenient. |
| Exported file `lightmock-config-<date>.json` | `mimicway-config-<date>.json` | Nothing: imports accept any file name. |

## Binary

Replace `light-mock` (or `light-mock.exe`) with `mimicway` (`mimicway.exe`) wherever you start it. Keep the same environment, in particular `DATA_PATH`, and it serves the same mocks.

## Docker

Keep the named volume that holds your data; only the image name changes:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 7342:7342 -v lightmock-data:/data ghcr.io/eoth/mimicway
```

With Compose, change the `image:` (or the `build:` tag) and leave the `volumes:` entry as it is.

## Kubernetes

The reference manifests now create a `mimicway` namespace and an empty `mimicway-data` volume. To keep the volume your configuration and backups live on today, apply them through a small overlay of your own instead, for instance `k8s/my-upgrade/kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
# The namespace your lightMock runs in today.
namespace: entreprise-tools
resources:
  - ../ingress            # or ../gloo-edge
patches:
  # Mount the volume that holds your configuration and backups today, instead of a new empty one.
  - target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: mimicway
    patch: |-
      - op: replace
        path: /spec/template/spec/volumes/0/persistentVolumeClaim/claimName
        value: lightmock-data
  - patch: |-
      $patch: delete
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      metadata:
        name: mimicway-data
```

Then:

```bash
NS=entreprise-tools

# 1. Stop lightMock: on SIGTERM it writes its pending changes, then releases the volume.
kubectl -n $NS scale deployment lightmock --replicas=0

# 2. Start Mimicway on the same volume.
kubectl apply -k k8s/my-upgrade
kubectl -n $NS rollout status deployment mimicway

# 3. Remove what lightMock used, except its volume.
kubectl -n $NS delete deployment/lightmock service/lightmock configmap/lightmock-config
kubectl -n $NS delete ingress/lightmock --ignore-not-found
```

With Gloo Edge, also delete the `lightmock` Upstream, RouteTable and VirtualService, and point the overlay at `../gloo-edge` (whose resources name the namespace in their specification: patch it there too, or keep the `mimicway` namespace and carry the configuration over by export and import, below).

To start clean in the new `mimicway` namespace instead, apply `k8s/ingress` as documented, then restore your configuration: export it from the old instance (Import/Export in the UI, or `GET /api/config`) and import it into the new one.

## Kafka

The consumer group used when `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP` is not set is now `mimicway`. A new group starts from the latest messages: nothing is consumed twice, but messages sent while the instance was stopped are not consumed. To carry on exactly where lightMock stopped, set `KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP=lightmock`.
